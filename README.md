Ready-to-use docker image of a full LaTeX installation on top of arch. Use at
your own peril.

[![Build Status][azure-shield]][azure-url] [![GitHub tag][tag-shield]][tag-url]

- __Arch-based.__ Always using the latest version of LaTeX (don't forget to rebuild).
- __Fonts included.__ Every Google font available.
- __CI/CD friendly.__ In case you're insane like me and want to compile
    documents inside a continuous integration pipeline.
- __Gigantic.__ OMEGABLOATED! Somewhat around 4 GB on a single image.
